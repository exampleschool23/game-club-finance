# Telegram daily finance report runbook

Read this before changing or operating the scheduled Telegram report.

## Pipeline and ownership

Each configured target is built independently from that club's Supabase rows:

```text
Supabase data -> calculations -> SVG -> PNG -> Telegram sendPhoto
  -> delivery status saved
```

Supabase Cron owns the production schedule. It runs daily at `01:00 UTC`, which
is `06:00 Asia/Tashkent`, and invokes the production endpoint for the previous
Tashkent business date. Migration
`041_supabase_daily_report_cron_and_delivery_audit.sql` replaces the named job
idempotently and reads its bearer credential from Supabase Vault.

The retry route files are recovery entry points, not independent production
schedules.

## Required configuration

Configure these only in trusted server/deployment environments:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `CRON_SECRET`
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
- At least one complete `TELEGRAM_<TARGET>_CHAT_ID` and
  `TELEGRAM_<TARGET>_CLUB_ID` pair

Supported target keys are `pixel`, `main`, and `bunker`. `CRON_SECRET` must be a
header-safe random string of at least 16 characters and must match the value
stored in Supabase Vault.

Before applying migration 041, create/update the Vault secret used by the cron:

```sql
select vault.create_secret(
  '<the deployment CRON_SECRET value>',
  'game_club_daily_report_cron_secret',
  'Bearer token used by the Game Club daily finance report cron'
);
```

After changing the deployment secret, redeploy so the function and scheduler
use the same value. Never commit or print the actual values.

## Deployment order

Apply migrations 037 and 038 before deploying application code that depends on
the delivery ledger and snapshot/payment integrity. Apply migration 041 only
after its Vault secret exists.

If application code arrives before the required database migration, the route
fails closed with HTTP 500 and sends nothing. A later recovery run can catch up
the same business date after the migration is applied.

## Rendering behavior

The route statically imports the Sharp renderer so Vercel traces the native
dependency. `vercel.json` includes Linux libvips and the Noto Sans TTF assets.
The font setup is evaluated before Sharp and creates a private fontconfig file,
so Russian labels do not rely on host-installed fonts.

If image generation fails before dispatch, the route logs the rendering error
and sends the same finance report as Telegram text. Once dispatch begins, a
transport problem follows delivery-ledger recovery rules; it does not switch
format and risk a duplicate.

Generate a local PNG preview from a real club/date without sending Telegram:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/generate-daily-finance-preview.ts 2026-08-27
```

## Delivery safety model

Migration 037 provides a service-only delivery ledger. Scheduled delivery is
unique by business date, target, and the fixed `scheduled` delivery key.
Intentional resends use `force:<uuid>`.

The route durably marks dispatch before contacting Telegram. A timeout, network
failure, malformed success response, or interrupted post-send finalization has
an unknown outcome. It is quarantined as `manual_review`; automatic recovery
must not resend it.

For `manual_review`:

1. Inspect the delivery row and structured error.
2. Check the target Telegram group for the expected report.
3. If the message exists, do not resend; reconcile the operational state.
4. If it is confirmed missing, perform one intentional forced resend.

Telegram message deletion is not treated as a delivery-state change.

## Dry runs and intentional resends

Use the protected endpoint with `dryRun=1` to build results without Telegram
delivery. Dry runs cannot be combined with forced delivery.

An intentional resend must specify exactly one date, one target, `force=1`, and
a caller-generated UUID:

```text
/api/cron/daily-finance-report?date=2026-08-26&target=pixel&force=1&requestId=40c05af5-5a59-45ae-a891-19a18228a721
```

Reuse the same `requestId` when retrying the same intended resend; it returns
the stored delivery rather than sending again. Generate a new UUID only when a
new Telegram message is explicitly intended.
