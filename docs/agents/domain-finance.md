# Finance domain guide

Read this before changing dashboard totals, reports, owner money, Telegram
finance output, or the meaning of an accounting field.

## Sources of truth

| Concept | Current ledger |
|---|---|
| Game-club collections | `daily_cash_entries` |
| Bar sales and cost of goods sold | `daily_stock_counts` |
| Inventory cash outflow | `stock_purchases` |
| Operating expenses | `expenses` |
| Customer debt principal | `new_debts` |
| Cash collected from debts | `debt_payments` |
| Owner money taken | `owner_withdrawals` |

The older `income_transactions`, `expense_transactions`, and `cash_movements`
tables are retired ledgers. They remain readable for history but must not accept
new application writes.

Every row above is club-owned. Always scope reports and mutations by `club_id`.

## Canonical formulas

Use the implementations under `src/lib/calculations`; these definitions explain
their intent but are not a second implementation.

```text
gameClubIncome = cash + terminal + card + playstation
barSales       = sum(daily_stock_counts.bar_income)
barCost        = sum(daily_stock_counts.bar_cost)
totalIncome    = gameClubIncome + barSales + debtIncome
totalExpenses  = sum(expenses.amount)
accountingNetProfit = totalIncome - barCost - totalExpenses
```

`debtIncome` in financial reports represents new debt principal for the period.
Debt payments are collections used in retained/available game-club money; do not
count the same cash as both new income and collection without checking the
specific report definition.

Accounting profit and available cash answer different questions:

- Cost of goods sold (`barCost`) reduces accounting profit.
- Inventory purchases are cash outflow and reduce bar cash left only on or after
  `STOCK_PURCHASE_DEDUCTION_START_DATE` (`2026-07-02`). This historical cutoff is
  defined in `src/lib/calculations/barMoney.ts`; do not duplicate or casually
  change it.
- An expense reduces the source selected by `payment_source`: `game_club` or
  `bar`.

```text
barCashLeft = barSales - qualifyingStockPurchaseCost - barExpenses
```

## Owner available money

`src/lib/calculations/availableMoney.ts` calculates independent monthly and
source-specific buckets:

```text
gameClubEarned = gameClubCollections + debtCollections - gameClubExpenses
barEarned      = barSales - qualifyingStockPurchases - barExpenses
available      = earned - prior withdrawals for the same month and source
```

Positive money in another month or source cannot validate an over-withdrawal.
The database RPC `withdraw_owner_money_for_month` atomically validates and records
a custom positive amount for one month. For `all`, it allocates Game Club first,
then Bar, without overdrawing either bucket. The legacy
`take_all_owner_money_for_month` remains available for older clients. Never
replace these RPCs with direct browser inserts.

Game Club withdrawals can be taken from one payment method
(`withdraw_owner_game_club_money_by_method`, migration 066). A method's
withdrawable amount is `min(method left for the month - method withdrawals,
Game Club available for the month)`; see `gameClubWithdrawalsByMethod` and
`availableForPaymentMethod` in `ownerProfitSnapshot.ts`. Withdrawals without a
method (older rows and `all`) are shown as unassigned, never guessed.

## Debts

- New debts begin unpaid with `paid_amount = 0` and the full amount remaining.
- Payment dates cannot precede the debt date or use a future club business date.
- Payments cannot exceed the remaining debt.
- Debt and payment rows are append-only for application users.
- A database trigger updates the parent balance and status after payment insert.

Keep UI validation for feedback, but rely on database constraints/triggers for
integrity under concurrency or direct API access.

## Dates and periods

Browser/server finance pages use the selected club's configurable business-day
start from `src/lib/utils.ts`. Scheduled Telegram reporting uses
`Asia/Tashkent` and reports the previous Tashkent business date. A calendar
month owner bucket is stored as its first day (`YYYY-MM-01`).

## Change checklist

When a formula changes, inspect all consumers: dashboard, daily/monthly reports,
money details, owner money, Telegram report, and tests. Prefer changing one pure
calculation and its tests rather than fixing each consumer independently.

## Employee salaries

`src/lib/calculations/salaries.ts` is the canonical payroll calculation.
`salary_employees` identifies staff (independent of login/team memberships),
`salary_rates` preserves effective-dated daily/monthly rates, KPI and active
status, and `salary_entries` holds append-only payments, bonuses and fines.

Daily salary accrues on active calendar days including the current business
date. Monthly salary accrues proportionally to the actual calendar days in
that month. Changes/deactivation start today; historical rates stay intact.
Same-business-day settings can be corrected. KPI percentages are weighted by
eligible days over elapsed days in that month.

KPI uses the existing Owner Profit **earned** cash definition before owner
withdrawals, after all accrued payroll costs, including KPI. Add back linked
salary payments to monthly earned cash, then deduct base + bonus - fine. With
`P` as that remainder and `r` as the sum of weighted employee KPI fractions,
remaining owner profit is `max(0, P) / (1 + r)`; each employee receives their
fraction of that remaining profit. Salary payment timing cannot change KPI.
Existing manual salary expenses remain ordinary expenses; do not record the
same payout again through payroll.

Employee balance = accrued base + KPI + bonuses - fines - payments. Negative
balances represent advances/credit and carry across months. Bonuses and fines
affect salary entitlement, not immediate cash. Payments create ordinary salary
expenses atomically, so current dashboards, owner money, reports and daily
Telegram totals already include their cash outflow without separate deduction.
Payroll balances/KPI are live estimates: later finance edits may change past KPI.
There is no closed payroll-period snapshot in this version.

Future salary employees are supported by migration `060_future_salary_employees.sql`. They accrue nothing before joining. `change_salary_term` changes only salary or KPI under the employee lock, effective on the club business date (or the future joining date), preserving the other terms and earlier rates.

Migration 062 adds audited deletion for salary entries and rates. `delete_salary_record` requires salary editing access and retains the original row with `deleted_at`/`deleted_by`. Payment deletion removes the linked expense atomically; direct payroll mutations remain forbidden. Calculations exclude deleted rows; history displays them. Deleting a rate extends the preceding rate until the next live rate and may change historical KPI/balances. Operations live at `/salaries`, employees at `/salaries/employees`, and individual history at `/salaries/employees/[employeeId]`.

Migration 065 preserves at least one live rate per employee. The Employee Settings
form can restore settings that were already deleted, effective today (or the
future joining date), without rewriting historical deleted rates. Payroll profit
inputs now use the member-authorized salary snapshot, independent of ledger
feature grants. Money Report expense totals include both payment sources;
method balances still deduct only Game Club expenses. Daily Cash uses the same
accounting-profit calculation as reports, including new debt principal and all
expenses; the metric is hidden when the member cannot read every required ledger.
